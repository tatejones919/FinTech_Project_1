## Project Description
Gold has always been championed as one of the best assets to combat against inflation and economic downturn.  We first want to compare if gold does perform better than market indicators during time of both high inflation and market downturn.  Crypto currency is also being touted as a new asset to combat this as well.  We will see if crypto currency has any correlation with gold during these events and if it too can be used to hedge one's portfolio

## Research Questions
Does Gold perform better than the major market indicators during these times?
Does crypto perform better than the major market indicators during these times?
Is there any correlation between either asset? Is there a stronger correlation during these times?

## Datasets
- Price of gold over a specified time
- Price of crypto over a specified time

## Break Down of tasks
- Create data sets of both assets
- Determine times of high inflation or economic downturn
- Through analysis do these perform better during these events
- Determine the risk of these assets during specified time
- Determine how each performs against market indicators
